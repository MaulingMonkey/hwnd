## Raison d'Ãªtre

Intended use cases include:
*   Building block for higher level APIs.
*   Interop with existing win32-consuming C or C++ codebases (incrementally RIIRing?)
*   Direct use for cases where extra abstraction / higher level APIs are overkill.

Goals to service these use cases, in order of priority, are:

0.  APIs should be as *sound* as possible.
    *   Spam unit tests and/or doc-tests to try to break safe APIs.
    *   Thorough safety documentation of any fns or traits that must remain `unsafe`.
1.  Keep a 1:1 mapping to raw windows types and APIs as much as possible.
    *   Maximum interoperability with existing C or C++ codebases.
    *   Avoids infinite yak shaving.
    *   Additional error checking / debug spam is generally discouraged to avoid suprising RIIRers with new edge cases, except to avoid soundness issues.
2.  Make APIs as safe as possible.
    *   Some `unsafe` will generally still be required to implement said APIs.
    *   Eliminating `unsafe` for perfectly sound APIs will make auditing the remaining `unsafe` code easier.
3.  Provide excellent documentation.
    *   Rust specific examples for everything.
    *   Thoroughly document edge cases, error codes, etc.
    *   Aiming to be even better than MSDN.
